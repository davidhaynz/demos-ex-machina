== Decision Making
This project is a fork of Networked Decision Making software, with a different purpose: to support democratic decision making in online or virtual meetings. It's very much in draft at the moment.

This project began life as a fork of link:https://github.com/DonaldMcC/gdms[Networked Decision Making by DonaldMcC], which has many or most of the features I want in this software package - but not configured the way I want them.

The idea behind this project is to create an online democratic decision-making process based on a "rules of order" that would be used in the meetings of a municipal authority or incorporated society. 

== Technical Description
Developed on the web2py framework, in Python.
Being redesigned as a web2py plug-in, or set of them.
