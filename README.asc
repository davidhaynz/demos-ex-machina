== Demos ex machina (the "people" or citizens, in the machine)
This project is very much in draft at the moment. It has begun life as a fork of the link:https://github.com/DonaldMcC/gdms[Networked Decision Making, by DonaldMcC] (NDS), but with a different purpose: to support formal democratic decision making in asynchronous online meetings. 

NDS has many or most of the features I want in this software package: you cna see a live demo of it  link:https://www.netdecisionmaking.com/nds/default/index[HERE].  The core idea behind NDS - of creating asynchronous online decision-making meetings - is smart. T, and it provides a good code base for what I'm working on.

The idea behind *this* project is to create online meetings based on the "rules of order" that would normally be applied in the meetings of (say) a municipal authority or incorporated society, here in New Zealand. The business rules embedded in the code could either be derived from, or expressed as, the formal  link:https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/about-auckland-council/how-auckland-council-works/governing-body-wards-committees/Documents/standing-orders-governing-body.pdf[Standing Orders] (rules) of such a body.

The intention is also to redesign the NDM code base as a web2py plug-in (or set of them) so that a group such as an incorporated society could embed it in their own website and utilise it for holding committee meetings.

=== Learning and Teaching democracy
Where NDS seeks to reinvent democracy, in some sense, this project seeks to reinforce it.  Democracy is a frail institution, globally, and it seems to be in retreat in some of the OECD nations.  

Most people have little direct experience of democracy. Our democratic institutions are often inaccessible, uninteresting, and distorted or obscured by the agendas and the interests of media and political parties. Corporations and public sector agencies, where most people work, typically function as authoritarian hierarchies. To a to a political scientist, their structures and organisational cultures most resemble totalitarian dictatorships - so that is what people are used to, in their daily lives, and what they come to expect.

A key purpose of this project is to create an accessible "democracy machine" that involves people in democratic decision-making and makes the process transparent to them. It will not teach them new and interesting ideas about, or approaches to, democracy. What they learn from using the app should be directly relateable to the way existing democratic institutions function, or are ideally supposed to function. 

The app may truncate and/or simplify some of those processes, but not ignore or replace them. It will also use the most democratic of existing systems and processes. For instance where there is a choice to be made between different voting systems in meetings and plebiscites, the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote["Single Transferable Vote"] system will be utilised rather a the simple majority vote.

Some specifications fall out of that:

* The democratic process embedded in the app will be based on known and long-established protocols of proven value: e.g. meetings will be chaired, have an agenda, items will require a mover and seconder, a formal "rules of order" will be followed, etc, etc.

* The asynchronous decision-making process will be time-limited: a meeting may take place over a period of days, or even weeks, and participation may be non-contiguous, but decisions will be made within a defined meeting timeframe.

* The full record of each meeting will be in text, captured by the app, but final decisions will be expressed as formal resolutions, which may then be linked to action items.

* Meetings will generally be held by elected representatives of the group, but the app will support plebiscites where all members may vote.

* The elections of representatives are plebiscites, and a type (subclass) of the generic decision-making process; but one where candidates are ranked instead of decision options.

* The site/s will be translateable, to help support and spread democracy around the world (one advantage of using web2py framework).

* The site layout and design will be mobile-first, especially for views and features exposed to group members and decision-makers (the more complex admin views might not be).

== Technical Description
Developed on the web2py framework, written in Python.
