== Decision Making
This project is a fork of Networked Decision Making software, with a different purpose: to support democratic decision making in online or virtual meetings. It's very much in draft at the moment.

This project began life as a fork of link:https://github.com/DonaldMcC/gdms[Networked Decision Making by DonaldMcC] (NDS), which has many or most of the features I want in this software package - but not configured the way I want them.  The core idea behind NDS - of creating asynchronous online decision-making meetings - is 

The idea behind this project is to create an asynchronous online democratic decision-making process based on a "rules of order" that would normally be used in the meetings of a municipal authority or incorporated society. The business rules embedded in the code could therfore be derived from, or expressed as, the formal standing orders (rules) of such an entity.

The intention is also to redesign the NDM code base as a web2py plug-in (or set of them) so that a group or entity such as an incorporated society could embed it in their own website and utilise it for holding .


== Technical Description
Developed on the web2py framework, in Python.
