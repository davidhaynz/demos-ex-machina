==Decision Making

This project is a fork of Networked Decision Making software, with a different purpose: to support democratic decision making in online or virutal meetings. It's very much in draft at the moment.

==Technical Description
Developed using web standards, python and the award winning web2py framework and best practices such as Model-View-Controller architecture, Separation of Concerns, and Don't Repeat Yourself.  Fast, intuitive UI featuring a custom application layout built using parts from Twitter Bootstrap, extensive AJAX and jQuery, .

==Secure
Can be deployed on any hardware or cloud platform and database that supports web2py

#Get Started
	* Install web2py on your preferred enivronment and configuration
	* Download and Install the Networked Decision Making package or
	* Start Web2py and point to the appropriate application url

#Configuration
The configuration options are fully detailed in the manual.  You don't need any configuration to get started but for a production site you need to consider the database and log-on methods at a minimum.

#How to Contribute
There are some TODO items still showing in the code but new features should generally be proposed on the Networked Decision Making Site itself for approval.  The idea is that this software has the inbuilt mechanism to decide on it's own evolution.
Fork the project, make your changes, test, then submit a pull request. Submit any new bugs or feature requests to the issues page.
