== Decision Making
This project is a fork of the Networked Decision Making project, with a different purpose: to support democratic decision making in asynchronous online meetings. It's very much in draft at the moment.

This project has begun life as a fork of link:https://github.com/DonaldMcC/gdms[Networked Decision Making by DonaldMcC] (NDS), which has many or most of the features I want in this software package.  The core idea behind NDS - of creating asynchronous online decision-making meetings - is great.

The idea behind this project is to create such meetings based on the "rules of order" that would normally be applied in the meetings of a municipal authority or incorporated society. The business rules embedded in the code could therefore be derived from, or expressed as, the formal standing orders (rules) of such an entity.

The intention is also to redesign the NDM code base as a web2py plug-in (or set of them) so that a group or entity such as an incorporated society could embed it in their own website and utilise it for holding their management committee meetings.


== Technical Description
Developed on the web2py framework, in Python.
